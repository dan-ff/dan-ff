### Hi, I'm Daniel. 👋

I'm a certified Databricks Data Engineer, focussing on Azure. I started out as developing data warehouses in 2019, then I went back to uni to study Big Data Analytics. I've had a couple of Data Science roles in the past but Data Engineering the best.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a Data Lakehouse on Azure Databricks, with some Data Factory, IoT, and Computer Vision mixed in.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go to broaden my skillset.
- ✍️ I also have a Data Engineering blog where I share example solutions and talk about data stuff.
